 - update argument on 'usage'
 - in DockerFils: add script on PATH !
 - quit R library loading ?
 - avoid 'Rplots.pdf' generated on current_dir
 - all posiiton af sequence length is considered: not only covered region SO, NOT ONLY POSITION ON BAM IN CASE WHERE BAM IS SUBSETED ON SPECIFIC REGION: manage-it by keep only specific region (new option) on all bed files and/or on R script (xscales) [impat for plotly ?]
    => fixed using xlimit of plot on r script, better to manage it at samtools step in order to avoir useless computing time and warning() du to undiplayed data
 - add warning to alert thath visualisation is not adapted for large sequence

 - area instead of line (but impossible to split primary and secondary axis ! notice it in legen name?)
 - min and max y depend only of good strand
 - reduce breacks ?
 - log by pretreatment ? of easy to manage it directly on graph ?
 - potential reads groups are ignored (samtools cmdline)
